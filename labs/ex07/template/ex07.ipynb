    "# PyTorch Basics\n",
    "[PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) is a deep learning framework. PyTorch works with tensors which are multidimensional arrays similar to the ones used in NumPy. Since you have already used NumPy in previous exercises we will introduce PyTorch in terms of the main differences from NumPy:\n",
    "* PyTorch can run operations on both CPU and hardware accelerators like GPUs. GPUs are particularly well suited for doing matrix multiplications which make up most of the computation in neural networks. Using GPUs can speed training up drastically, often on the order of ~100x for decently sized neural networks involving large matrix-matrix multiplications.\n",
    "* PyTorch has automatic differentiation that allows it to compute the derivatives of most functions. You don't need to derive or implement the formulas for the gradients. This is especially useful for training neural networks through gradient descent.\n",
    "* PyTorch provides implementations of various neural network components, dataloading utilities, and optimization tools, making it much easier to specify and train neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure you have PyTorch installed ([see instructions](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)) or run this notebook on Google colab (recommended if you don't have a GPU). You can import PyTorch as:"

    "## PyTorch Tensors\n",
    "Tensors (`torch.Tensor`) are similar to the multidimensional arrays used in NumPy (`numpy.ndarray`). The functions to create them often have similar names and arguments. We will use the function `torch.ones()` to highlight some of the differences between NumPy and PyTorch. The signatures for the two functions are:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "torch.ones(*size, *, out=None, dtype=None, layout=torch.strided, device=None, requires_grad=False)\n",
    "numpy.ones(shape, dtype=None, order='C', *, like=None)\n",
    "```\n",
    "* There are often subtle differences in the syntax. For example, the size argument of `torch.ones` can either accept a tuple or a variable number of integers but  NumPy only supports a tuple/list. Another common one is that PyTorch referes to `axis` as `dim` in operations such as `sum` and `mean`.\n",
    "* Each tensor has a device associated with it and resides in the memory of that device. This is specified via the device argument used in all tensor creation ops. By default, this is the CPU (`device='cpu'`), but can also be the GPU (`device='cuda'`) or e.g. `device='cuda:0'` if you have many GPUs. All tensors involved in a given operation e.g. addition or matrix multiplication must recide on the same device. An existing tensor `T` can be moved to other devices in through commands such as `T.cpu()`, `T.cuda()`, `T.to(device='cuda')`. Each of these will return a new copy of the tensor on the target device.\n",
    "* The default floating point precision in PyTorch is `torch.float32` but in NumPy this varies more and is often `numpy.float64`. If you are unfamiliar with floating point numbers, you can think of them as being equivalent to the scientific notation e.g. $\\pm 1.23456 \\cdot 10^{E}$, but in binary. Each format supports a specific range for the exponent $E$ and has a given number of significant digits. Float32 operations typically run significantly faster than float64 operations and require less memory, but are not as precise. For neural networks you should not use float64 unless you have a really good reason for it. In fact many operations in neural networks can be performed in even lower precision such as `torch.bfloat16` or `torch.float16`. These formats require less memory and run faster on hardware that supports it, but may require special tricks for training.\n",
    "* Each tensor T in PyTorch can either have `T.requires_grad==True` or `T.requires_grad==False`. When requires_grad is True, PyTorch will keep track of operations involving this tensor in a structure referred to as a computation graph. PyTorch can backpropagate through a computation graph to compute gradients for the tensors involved."

We will be using a fully connected network so we flatten each element into a $d=784$ element vector. We will have one output for each class. We will use softmax to turn these outputs into probabilities for each class and the cross entropy with a one-hot encoding of the label as our loss.\n",

Our inputs to the network are a $n \\times d$ vector, i.e. a minibatch of $n$ flattened images. We will use three hidden layers of width 128 and a final output layer with 10 features corrsponding to each class. The output shape of a layer with width $K$ is $n \\times K$. \n",
