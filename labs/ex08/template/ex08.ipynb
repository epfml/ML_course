    "# Exercise 1 - MLPs, CNNs and Shift Invariance\n",
    "Signals and sequences make up many common and interesting forms of data. A signal measures some output quantity as a function of an independent variable. Examples include audio (pressure as a function of time) and images (intensity as a function of direction or distance). Written language can be viewed as an an ordered sequence of symbols (letters or words).\n",
    "\n",
    "When using a fully connected networks (MLPs) with signals or sequences we form a vector that is then fed into the network. An MLP makes no assumptions about the data, neither about the order / relation between the elements or the meaning of the each input (they could be completely different as can be the case with e.g. tabular data). As a result, an MLP may need to learn to classify signals with different shifts separately (e.g. a slightly shifted image could look completely different to these networks).\n",
    "\n",
    "Convolutions on the other hand are shift invariant, shifting the input shifts the output by the same amount. This makes convolutions a natural candidate for dealing with signals. The same weights can be used to detect a feature across all locations and features learned in one area should generalize to different locations. As a result, convolutional networks (CNNs) should generally be much more robust to translations/shifts in the input data. Note however, that CNNs are generally not fully shift invariant since they contain other operations such as pooling, padding and potentially fully connected layers at the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this exercise is to explore how MLPs and CNNs respond to shifted inputs.\n",
    "Our base dataset is going to be MNIST (again, since it is relatively tractible and trains in a short amount of time).\n",
    "We will explore the performance of each network in three cases:\n",
    "* The original images.\n",
    "* Images with an expanded canvas, where an original image is randomly inserted.\n",
    "* A shuffled version of the original images (with the same shuffling across all images).\n",
    "\n",
    "The exercise is broken down into several steps:\n",
    "* Loading and creating the datasets\n",
    "* Defining the networks\n",
    "* Writing the training script\n",
    "* Measuring the performance of each setting (network and data combination)"

    "\n",
    "The arguments used for the DataLoaders can affect the speed of training significantly. If the data loading is not fast enough it stalls the training and the GPU/CPU spends a lot of time just waiting for data. For training we want to shuffle the order of the samples in each epoch (not needed for validation), and also use pinned memory when using a GPU for faster transfers. The DataLoader uses multiprocessing, spinning up other processes to load the data, freeing the main process to run the rest of the training script. The ideal number of data worker processes depends on the number of CPU cores available and the computational requirements of data loading. When running this notebook on the free tier Google Colab instances you can set `num_workers=2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the test set as a validation set. This is bad practice, you should use a separate portion of the train set as validation set for real projects. In this case it simplifies the implementation and proper validation is not the focus of the exercise.\n"

We use [AdamW](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.optim.AdamW.html#torch.optim.AdamW), a variant of Adam that uses a different form of weight decay that is usually more effective than standard Adam. AdamW is one of the most commonly used optimizers today. We also use a [Cosine Decay learning rate schedule](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.optim.lr_scheduler.CosineAnnealingLR.html#torch.optim.lr_scheduler.CosineAnnealingLR) which is a good default schedule and the likely the first one you should try in your own projects."
