The idea of FGSM training is simple: while training, adapt the training data to be a worst-case adversarial example by using the method developed before (details can be found in Section 5 of the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.6572.pdf)).\n",

In case you are interested, see [this recent paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.02617.pdf) that discusses this issue in detail. More generally, accurate evaluation of adversarial robustness of neural networks is a complicated topic and many papers have been written on this (a good summary can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.06705)), and we won't go into more detail here, and we'll assume that FGSM attack is a good proxy for measuring the robustness of our model.\n",
