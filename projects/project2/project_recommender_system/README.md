# Project Recommender System

For this choice of project task, you are supposed to predict good recommendations, e.g. of movies to users. We have acquired ratings of 10000 users for 1000 different items (think of movies). All ratings are integer values between 1 and 5 stars. No additional information is available on the movies or users.

### Evaluation Metric
Your collaborative filtering algorithm is evaluated according to the prediction error, measured by root-mean-squared error (RMSE).

### Submission system environment setup:

1. The dataset is available from the Kaggle page, as linked in the PDF project description

2. All information of the task and some baselines are provided in Exercise 10:
